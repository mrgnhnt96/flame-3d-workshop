# Flutter & Friends 2025 - flame_3d Workshop


This is a central hub for all materials related to @luanpotter and @wolfenrain's Flame 3D Workshop
on Flutter & Friends 2025, including slides, templates and examples.

The goal of the workshop is to get everyone set up and running with a basis for creating 3D games or
applications using the `flame_3d` package.


## Requirements


- impeller, flutter gpu and especially flame_3d are highly experimental; join if you want to
trailblaze, pave new paths, work and discover together. Do not join if you want production ready,
out-of-box, stable and tested frameworks.
- currently, we only extensively tested flame_3d on macOS. Sadly, flutter_gpu does not work on
Linux (or Windows) yet. We are highly anticipating the moment that the gods of Flutter bestow Linux
support upon us. In the meantime, we are relegated to using macOS. We've heard that it should work
on Android and iOS but have not tested it thoroughly.
- no prior knowledge about 3D rendering, how games or Flame work is required.


## Outcome


We will start from scratch and get some 3D objects into the world, a player-controlled character,
camera and lighting. Then, depending on what each attendee wants to accomplish, we can cover
textures, skeletal animations, and more.
